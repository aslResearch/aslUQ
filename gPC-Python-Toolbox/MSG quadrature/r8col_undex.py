## R8COL_UNDEX returns unique sorted indexes for an R8COL.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    An R8COL is an M x N array of R8 values, regarded as N columns
#    each of M R8 values.
#
#    The goal of this routine is to determine a vector UNDX,
#    which points, to the unique elements of X, in sorted order,
#    and a vector XDNU, which identifies, for each entry of X, the index of
#    the unique sorted element of X.
#
#    This is all done with index vectors, so that the elements of
#    X are never moved.
#
#    The first step of the algorithm requires the indexed sorting
#    of X, which creates arrays INDX and XDNI.  (If all the entries
#    of X are unique, then these arrays are the same as UNDX and XDNU.)
#
#    We then use INDX to examine the entries of X in sorted order,
#    noting the unique entries, creating the entries of XDNU and
#    UNDX as we go.
#
#    Once this process has been completed, the object X could be
#    replaced by a compressed object XU, containing the unique entries
#    of X in sorted order, using the formula
#
#      XU(1:X_UNIQUE_NUM) = X(UNDX(1:X_UNIQUE_NUM)).
#
#    We could then, if we wished, reconstruct the entire vector X, or
#    any element of it, by index, as follows:
#
#      X(I) = XU(XDNU(I)).
#
#    We could then replace X by the combination of XU and XDNU.
#
#    Later, when we need the I-th entry of X, we can locate it as
#    the XDNU(I)-th entry of XU.
#
#    Here is an example of a vector X, the sort and inverse sort
#    index vectors, and the unique sort and inverse unique sort vectors
#    and the compressed unique sorted vector.

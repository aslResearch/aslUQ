def vec_colex_mine(dim_num, base, point_index, rep):

## VEC_COLEX_NEXT3 generates vectors in colex order.    
#  Discussion:
#
#    The vectors are produced in colexical order, starting with
#    (1,1,...,1),
#    (2,1,...,1),
#    ...
#    (BASE(1),BASE(2),...,BASE(DIM_NUM)).
#
#  Example:
#
#    DIM_NUM = 2, 
#    BASE = [ 3, 3]
#
#    1   1
#    2   1
#    3   1
#    1   2
#    2   2
#    3   2
#    1   3
#    2   3
#    3   3

#
#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, integer DIM_NUM, the spatial dimension.
#
#    Input, integer BASE(DIM_NUM), the base to be used in each dimension.
#
#    Input, integer A(DIM_NUM), except on the first call, this should
#    be the output value of A on the last call.
#
#    Input, logical MORE, should be FALSE on the first call, and
#    thereafter should be the output value of MORE from the previous call.  
#
#    Output, integer A(DIM_NUM), the next vector.
#
#    Output, logical MORE, is TRUE if another vector was computed.
#    If MORE is FALSE on return, then ignore the output value A, and
#    stop calling the routine.

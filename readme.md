This repository carries out quantification and propagation of uncertainties in stochastic dynamical systems using Generalized Polynomial Chaos Expansion.

Run main.m file inside MSG Quadrature to obtain mixed sparse grid points and weights

Run msg_quadrature(d, L, d_Gaussian, d_Uniform) to obtain mixed sparse grid points, given d = number of uncertain variables, L = accuracy level, d_Gaussian = number of Gaussian random variables, d_Uniform = Number of Uniform random variables

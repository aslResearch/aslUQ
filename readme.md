This repository carries out quantification and propagation of uncertainties in stochastic dynamical systems using Generalized Polynomial Chaos Expansion.

Inside MSG Quadrature: Run msg_quadrature(d, L, d_Gaussian, d_Uniform) to obtain mixed sparse grid points, given d = number of uncertain variables, L = accuracy level, d_Gaussian = number of Gaussian random variables, d_Uniform = Number of Uniform random variables


Inside MSG Quadrature: Run main.m file where you can specify inputs to msg_quadrature to obtain mixed sparse grid points and weights
